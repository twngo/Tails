"Using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP to connect to a website allows you to "
"encrypt your communication with the server. But encryption alone does not "

"使用 HTTPS 取代明文的 HTTP 來進行網站連線，可以加密訪客與伺服器之間的通訊。但"

"SSL certificates try to solve this problem. A SSL certificate is usually "

"Commercial certificate authorities are making a living out of selling SSL "

"商用憑證機構靠出售 SSL 憑證為生，它們往往為大多數瀏覽器所自動信任。其它的非商"
