<div class="note">
If Tails 3.0.1 is working fine for you, please ignore this message!
</div>

If you upgraded Tails 3.0 to 3.0.1 with an **automatic upgrade** you
most likely are experiencing problems, one of the most serious being
that [[!tails_ticket 13426 desc="Tor does not work"]] which makes most
Internet activity impossible.

If you are affected you can repair your Tails 3.0.1 by doing a
[[manual upgrade|upgrade]] to 3.0.1.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
